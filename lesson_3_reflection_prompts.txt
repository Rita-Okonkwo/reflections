When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository if I want other
    people to contribute to my project as well.It also serves
    as backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to pull changes manually so that I don't get an
    unexpected code in my work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: Used for cloning a github repository to my own profile.
           Only used on github.
    clones: Used to clone a copy of a remote repository or a local repository.
    branches: Used to make a new segment in a particular repository.
    
    I would use clone when I want to have a copy of a git or github repository.
    I would use fork only when I want to have a copy of a github repository.
    I would use branches when I want to have another segment in a particular
    repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
