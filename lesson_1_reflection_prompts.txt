How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to use the command "FC" on my windows command line. That way, the command line was able to output only the lines of code that were different from each other thereby saving time used to compare and making me more productive.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I'd always have a version to to fall back to when future challenges arise.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manual commit: More flexibility, Irrelevant code versions do not have to be saved.
    Cons of manual commit: Poor commit decisions, Might forgrt to save an important code version.
    Pros of automatic saving: deals with cons of forgetfullness
    Cons of automatic saving: Irrelevant code versions can be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Most times, Git is used by programmers and sometimes in the world of programming two or more files are interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: This git command is used to view the history of recent commits of a particular repository with their commit IDs included.

    git diff: This git command is used to compare two commits made to a particular repository. by pasting git diff and and the ID of the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could always checkout of a particular change(commit) 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I got selected to participate in GSSoC(GirlScript summer of code) and I'm trying to brush up my git and github skills so that I can become more comfortable when contribution starts.
